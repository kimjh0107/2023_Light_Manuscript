Overview of 3D tomogram analysis of septic shock and healthy control
**a**, Schematic of the experimental workflow. Blood sampled were drawn in three times in the septic shock cohort and once in the healthy control. At each septic shock time points and healthy control, CD8+ T cells were imaged 3-D RI tomogram.

PBMCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells; ICU, intensive care unit;

## Figure 2 - Distribution of RI reflects immune status in sepsis

The mean RI distribution of the CD8+ T cell **a** in septic shock of each time points and healthy control and **b** survivals and non-survivals.

**c** 3D view of a single [[CD8+ T cell lymphocyte]] cut through the middle. For quantification of RI distribution, the segmented nucleus is divided into 8 concentric 3D radial shells (gray).

## Figure 3 - Performance of the classification model

Performance of the classification models.
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of proposed method with 1 to 5 cells in classifying **a** septic shock status and healthy control and **b** survival and non-survival. AUROC and associated 95% confidence intervals are included. _Blue dots_ depict precision and recall rate of each clinical indices which was used to predict sepsis diagnosis and prognosis. Reduction of error in classifying **c** septic shock status and healthy control and **d** survival and non-survival. The error reduction is sharper than a simple reciprocal function owing to the feature-extracting ability of the classification models.
AUROC, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve;

## Abstract

Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to infection that leads to organ dysfunction and is associated with high incidence and mortality rate. The lack of reliable biomarkers for diagnosing and prognosis of sepsis is a major challenge in its management. 

We aimed to investigate the potential of three-dimensional label-free CD8+ T cell morphology as a biomarker for sepsis. This study included three time points in the sepsis recovery cohort (N = 8) and healthy controls (N = 20). Morphological features and spatial distribution within cells were compared among the patients’ statuses.

We developed a deep learning model to predict the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis using the internal cell morphology. Correlation between the morphological features and clinical indices were analysed. Cell morphological features and spatial distribution differed significantly between patients with sepsis and healthy controls and between the survival and non-survival groups.

The model for predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of nearly 100% with only a few cells, and a strong correlation between the morphological features and clinical indices was observed. 

Our study highlights the potential of three-dimensional label-free CD8+ T cell morphology as a promising biomarker for sepsis. This approach is rapid, requires a minimum amount of blood samples, and has the potential to provide valuable information for the early diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis.
